# AWS Logs System

A serverless logging system built with **NestJS**, **AWS SNS**, **SQS**, and **DynamoDB**. This system receives logs, processes them through SNS and SQS, and notifies users in case of critical errors. Designed for **scalability, reliability, and real-time error alerting**.

## Features
- **NestJS Backend**: Handles incoming logs and manages AWS services.
- **AWS SNS & SQS**: Asynchronous message processing and user notifications.
- **DynamoDB Storage**: Stores log records efficiently.
- **Serverless Deployment**: Uses AWS Lambda and Serverless Framework.

## Architecture
1. Logs are received through a **REST API**.
2. The logs are stored in **DynamoDB**.
3. A log message is published to an **SNS topic**.
4. The SNS topic sends messages to an **SQS queue**.
5. The SQS queue triggers processing and, if the log is an error, an alert is sent to subscribed users via SNS.

## Installation
